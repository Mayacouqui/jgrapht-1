<h1><font size="7"><font color="#CC3399">J</font>Graph<font color="#FFCC00">T</font> </font>Project Policies</h1>



<br>
<p>
The intent of these policies is to direct the JGraphT development in an orderly 
fashion. These are by no means "hard-rules" and they can be changed. If you have 
suggestions of how to do things better, please send them over. However, until 
any such suggestions are accepted you are expected to conform to these policies.
</p>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Credits & Ego</h3>

<p>
1.1.&nbsp; You must retain the original authorship of files even if you rewrote them 
ground-up and did not use any of the original. You probably built on mistakes of 
the original author/s and they still deserve the credits for their pioneering 
work.
</p>
 

<p>1.2.&nbsp; Fixing bugs in someone else's code or adding little features does not 
entitle you co-authorship. However, if you made substantial contribution you may 
add your name at the end of the author list. </p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp; Expect your code to change and evolve. None of us do everything right the 
first time even if we're great programmers, which of course we are :). Please 
welcome the changes others introduce to your code and try to judge them in an 
&quot;ego-neutral&quot; manner. </p>
 

<h3>2.&nbsp; Coding Conventions</h3>

<p>2.1.&nbsp; <i>"One consistent look"</i>. The code of JGraphT should have one consistent look. 
It is important since JGraphT is a class library, and not a closed product. 
Our users will look into the code very often. If we confuse them with many coding 
styles they will hate us and underestimate our professionalism. If we give them 
one consistent look, they will love us (even if our styling will differ from 
their taste). As a general rule, watch existing classes and do alike.</p>

<p>2.2.&nbsp; <i>Automated tools</i>. The "Jalopy" and "Checkstyle" tools are used and greatly 
help to achieve one consistent look -- it is strongly recommended that you use 
them. The both have plugins for various IDEs. 
You can find more about them in the &quot;etc&quot; folder of JGraphT. </p>

<p>2.3.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Principle of least surprise&quot;</i> should be practiced. A method should do what 
its name suggests and should not have unrelated side effects. Try to make things 
expected as an alternative to referring users to the documentation. Ideally, 
users should be able to do an &quot;auto-complete&quot; programming with JGraphT. Ideally, 
they would not need to read the documentation. </p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Simplicity is gold&quot;</i>. Your code should be <b>as simple as possible</b> 
(especially the public API for our users). &quot;Simple&quot; does not mean stupid. If you need to do clever 
things, do clever things. However, don't do clever if you can do simple! </p>


<p>2.5&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;Professional finishing</i>. Your release-ready code should 
not raise compiler warnings (to the extent possible). It should include a 
complete Javadoc in a way that execution of&nbsp; <code>'ant javadoc'</code>&nbsp; 
will output no complains 
concerning it. If the code has external influences (e.g., additional libraries, 
variations to ANT script) please make sure they are taken care of.</p>


<h3>3.&nbsp; Member's dos and don'ts</h3>

<p>3.1.&nbsp; JGraphT is a nice project of nice people. It is a strictly <b>no-flame project</b>! A flame incident, whether 
against other members or against JGraphT users, will result in an immediate removal 
of the involved member from the JGraphT team. The authorship credits of such member 
might be renamed to "unascribed".
</p>


<p>3.2.&nbsp; Members should not modify the JGraphT project website - this task is done 
by the project admin.

</p>

<p>
3.3.&nbsp; New members should NOT commit changes to CVS before reviewed by other members. This 
is done in order to allow new members to receive feedback on their code before 
committing, hence prevent creating CVS mess on "startup mistakes".</p>


<p>
3.4&nbsp; Member should not commit to CVS a code that does not compile. The code 
should be compatible with JDK1.3 or above.</p>


<p>3.5.&nbsp; Lastly, the members in the JGraphT project may be of different levels of experience and 
proficiency. If you are a "wizard", be kind to and patient with the "newbies" - 
you've also been a newbie once. If you are a less experienced developer, learn 
to appreciate 
the inputs from the "wizards" - these can be important and valuable contributions for your 
own professional growth.
</p>

<br>
That's all there is to it!
