Development Plan</h1>



<br>
<p>This is a working document where the development plan is maintained. The 
document is sorted according to versions in descending order (newest version at 
the top). For each version there is a list of development items related to that 
version. These items have one of the following statuses<font color="#7AA1E6">*</font> attached to them: </p>

<table style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" borderColor="#7aa1e6" cellSpacing="0" 
		cellPadding="5" bgColor="white" border="1" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><b>proposed</b></td>
    <td>A proposed development item for a release. This status mark includes initials of 
    the person who 
    proposed it. After mail discussion, such 
    item will either be <i>committed</i>, <i>rejected</i>, or <i>deferred</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><b>committed</b></td>
    <td>A committed item is one that we have decided to address for a 
    release.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><b>deferred</b></td>
    <td>A reasonable proposal that did not make it in to this release for some 
    reason. It is marked as <i>deferred</i> with a brief note as to why they were deferred. 
    Deferred plan items may resurface as proposed plan items at a later point.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><b>rejected</b></td>
    <td>Plan items that were proposed but judged unworkable are marked as 
    rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary of why they were 
    dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating the discussion.</td>

<h3>Following Versions </h3>



<p>Automatic graph layout when visualizing via the JGraph adapter. Employ the 
ready-made JGraph layouts to a achieve a quick and automatic way to take a given 
graph and visualize it. <i>(proposed BN)</i></p>



<p>Integration with GraphViz</p>



<p>GraphViz is a nice tool for automated layout. <b>Discussion: </b>The Java 
port (grappa) <br>
looks pretty useless since it doesn't even do layout, but another <br>
possible integration method is to generate files in their format (dot) <br>
and exec GraphViz . For a live display rather than a static image, <br>
you'd have to tell GraphViz to produce dot output, and then parse it for <br>
the location info. <i>(proposed JVS)<br>
</i>As a first lame integration, it's enough that we generate the dot files and 
automatically post them against a GraphViz server (like the demo at
<a href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/fsademo/">
http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/fsademo/</a>). This will keep us platform 
independent and will allow users to see their graphs (however, only in browser). 
<i> (proposed BN)</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>



<h3>Version 0.4.2</h3>



<p>Graph trigger listeners and graph assertions. <b>Discussion:</b> 
GraphTriggerListener extends GraphListener, receives &quot;before&quot; events, and can 
throw (unchecked) exceptions to abort the action. Graph assertions are 
implementations of GraphTriggerListener which enforce graph properties. an 
AbstractGraphAssertion class will isolate the exception handling from the 
logical checks, and make it easy to use composites. Methods of that class will 
redirect to a testing method that will return boolean flag to indicate an 
approved operation. Example: the AbstractGraphAssertion receives the 'beforeVertexAdded(v)' 
call, and tests the approveAddVertex(v) method - if true it returns, if false 
throws some assertion exception. The approveAddVertex(v) is, of course, 
polymorphic. <i>(proposed JVS+BN)</i></p>

<p>Automatic JUnit execution in ANT build script. <i>(committed)</i></p>



<p>Min-cut max-flow algorithm. <i>(proposed LR)</i></p>
<p>Shortest path algorithm. <i>(proposed BN)</i></p>



<p>Minimum spanning tree algorithm. <i>(proposed BN)</i></p>



<p>More rigorous unit tests for basic graphs. Basic graphs are the 
non-delegating graphs, which are based on the AbstractBaseGraph class and are the 
very core of JGraphT. <i>(proposed BN)</i></p>

<p>Graph connectivity predicates and iteration of connected components of 
undirected graphs. <i>(committed)</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Version 0.4.1&nbsp; (released)</h3>

<p>Depth first iteration and breadth first iteration. <i>(committed)</i></p>

<p>A separate unit test hierarchy in 'testsrc' that shadows the package 
structure of 'src'. Package naming within 'testsrc' is the same as in 'src'. 
Class naming is the same as in 'src', only suffixed with 'Test'. <i>(committed)</i></p>

<p>Refactoring of inner classes of GraphFactory. <i>(committed)</i></p>

<p>JGraph adapter <i>(committed)</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 0.4.0&nbsp; (released)</h3>



<p>
Initial publicly available version of JGraphT.</p>
